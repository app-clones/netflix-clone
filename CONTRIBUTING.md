# Contributing

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch
3. Push your changes to that branch
4. Submit a pull request
    - In the pull request describe what changes you made, why you made those changes, and why you think they're neccesary
5. Be patient with the pull request review process, as I am very busy with school at the moment
